This site exists for educational purposes. Every time I learn something new in web development I try it out by expanding this repo. In the end it might turn out to be something cool. Feel free to contribute. although I realize there isn't much interesting stuff here for experienced web developers, but I hope that changes in the future.

Thanks for reading, have a great day!
