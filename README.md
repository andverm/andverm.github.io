This site exists for educational purposes. Every time I learn something new in web development I try it out by expanding this repo. In the end it might turn out to be something cool. Feel free to contribute, although I realize there isn't much interesting stuff here for experienced web developers, but I hope that changes in the future.

Thanks for reading, have a great day!

- `float: left;` allowed to place text next to image, but caused preceding blocks to break.
**SOLVED**: Placed `<br style="clear: left">` after block.
